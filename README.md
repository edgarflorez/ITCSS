[^settings]:  used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
[^tools]:  globally used mixins and functions. Itâ€™s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
[^generic]:  reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
[^elements]:  styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
[^objects]:  class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS
[^components]:  specific UI components. This is where the majority of our work takes place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components
[^utilities]:  utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class
